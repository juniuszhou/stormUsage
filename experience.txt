1. when package for submit, you must exclude the storm-core from your
application jar package. otherwise there is duplicated configuration file error.

<dependencySets>
    <dependencySet>
      <outputDirectory>/</outputDirectory>
      <unpack>true</unpack>
      <excludes>
        <exclude>storm:storm</exclude>
      </excludes>
    </dependencySet>
  </dependencySets>

2. pay attention to configure file 's format.
    yaml file format is very strict.

3. how to install clojure
sudo apt-get install clojure1.4

4. https://github.com/velvia/ScalaStorm/blob/master/build.sbt
to see how to define sbt file in storm application.

5. package
if duplicate binding for slf4j or class problem.
you should remove storm-core from artifact
you should remove redundant slf4j log implementation jar from artifact.
that is to remove backlog jar.
