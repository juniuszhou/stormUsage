Stream unbound sequences of tuples
spouts source of stream. both reliable and unreliable source. spout can emit more than a stream.
bolts consumer of stream

task is one execution thread.

#### Grouping
how stream is partitioned among bolt's tasks.
1. shuffle grouping: random partition
2. Fields grouping: partition accroding to one field. then each bolt deal with tuple of same field value
3. partial key grouping: field grouping and load balance
4. all grouping: replicated to all bolts
5. global grouping: stream go to single bolt
6 none grouping: currently equal to shuffle one.
7 direct grouping: producer decide which bolt deal with stream
8 local or grouping: if bolt has more tasks in same worker process, tuple just shuffle in-process tasks.
