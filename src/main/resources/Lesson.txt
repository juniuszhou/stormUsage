#### good code example for scala storm.
// https://github.com/velvia/ScalaStorm


#### there is an error of compilation
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/storm-user/HOzYncAlm_A

#### when use scala to call storm or other jvm. maybe we need type conversion.



#### run word count, some error about class not found.
