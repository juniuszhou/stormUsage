#### flow of spout.
1. the nextTuple called to get a new tuple.
2. open called and use its parameter spoutOutputCollector to emit
the tuple to output streams. and also provide message id from message
queue. for instance id from kestrel or kafka.
3. after whole handling tree executed, the ack will be called.
otherwise the fail will be called.

#### anchor tuple. one way to reach reliability.
if we ack in bolt and emit original data from spout, it is an anchored tuple.
then we can tell message queue the spout tuple is handled.
even some exception happened, then we can start from this bolt.
it is very similar to checkpoint mechanism in spark.

one skill is we can put several spout tuple together then emit them all and ack.


for efficiency, we can see TOPOLOGY_ACKERS bigger than one. then we have more than
one tasks working as ack task.
