1. when package for submit, you must exclude the storm-core from your
application jar package. otherwise there is duplicated configuration file error.

<dependencySets>
    <dependencySet>
      <outputDirectory>/</outputDirectory>
      <unpack>true</unpack>
      <excludes>
        <exclude>storm:storm</exclude>
      </excludes>
    </dependencySet>
  </dependencySets>

2. pay attention to configure file 's format.
    yaml file format is very strict.

3. how to install clojure
sudo apt-get install clojure1.4

4. https://github.com/velvia/ScalaStorm/blob/master/build.sbt
to see how to define sbt file in storm application.

5. package
if duplicate binding for slf4j or class problem.
you should remove storm-core from artifact
you should remove redundant slf4j log implementation jar from artifact.
that is to remove backlog jar.

6. you can't run topology submit in IDE successfully.
since storm need read the configuration from yaml file
maybe other environment variables. so you can't connect to nimbus.
you must put in in package and then submit via storm jar command.

7. if you create named stream in spout or bolt. then must point out
the stream name in its next stream bolt.
"defaultOne" cannot be saved. so from here, we can see when storm create the
   topology and validate it, the emit stream name and received stream name must
   be checked.
tb.setBolt("split", new TickBolt(), 1).shuffleGrouping("spout", "defaultOne")

8. one bolt can receive multiple streams from different spout/bolt.
so the stream model beyond the tree.
